The CoreCrafted Network [#]_ , originally referred as "REDCRAFT x i-survivenetwork" is a combined server of REDCRAFT
and i-survive network, hosted saperately by ThisTNTSquid and jasonc123456 respectively.

As of 2014 summer, |jason| first meets ThisTNTSqud at REDCRAFT [#]_ , and started a good relationship. Afterward, they
both inventigate a method for joining 2 servers together and share common server entry permissions, and share the hosting machine
later on. it was a hit to the server. However, at one month later , |jason| decide to join the GameHub and halted the cooperation with |tnt|.
REDCRAFT went on self-hosting once again.

At October 2014, GameHub was down and |jason| decided not to operate the server anymore and leased the hosting machine to |tnt|. After few weeks of running,
|jason| decide to jump in again, and created a combined server "REDCRAFT x i-survive network". Everything was going so well, until one day.....

Few months later, because failure of both server's domain caused by the doamin provider, a new doamin is required for
continuing server operation. Therefore, a name of CoreCrafted Network was born , along with the "`corecrafted.net`__" domain name

Up until now, we have undergone several big changes to the content [#]_, as well as the server hardware [#]_
