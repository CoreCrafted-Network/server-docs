**The Economy Survival** [#]_ server (EcoSMP as referred to the internal unique server identifier) is a newly
introduced server, collaborating mod packs with vanilla minecraft. (It sounds strange, but it really is)

It is created as a "replacement" server of the old original faction-survival server. The Economy Survival server as
it name said. It emphasises active economic activity between players instead of the server-controlled economy.
